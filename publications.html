				<p><span style="font-size:1.8em;">A</span>re you cheesed off with having to live up to other people's expectations?  Are you fed up with parents, teachers or personal advisers trying to steer you along a path that bears no resemblance to the one you want to follow?<br /><br />
				Worse - do you believe that other people are better than you and therefore stand a greater chance of achieving more with their lives?<br /><br />
				Let Rachel Hall-Smith help you address those feelings as she guides you through the career choice maze and helps you come to terms with who you are and what you are capable of achieving.<br /><br />
				You'll be encouraged to acknowledge that God really cares about every aspect of your life - that he really does have plans and purposes for you, and that he wants you to see your working life as much more than simply earning a daily crust.<br /><br />
				Rachel Hall-Smith has worked as a Careers Adviserfor 16 years, assisting students in high schools, sixth forms and colleges of further education.<br /><br />
				She draws on her professional expertise and personal Christian experience to encourage young people to both explore the full range of options open to them and to seek the Lord's special purpose for their lives.</p><br />

				Do you wonder if God talks your language?<br />
				Do you ever want to ask advice?<br />
				What are God's answers for today and does he text?<br /><br />
				Well, you may not remember LBM but FYI God has the prototype of instant communication - Prayer. HUH he invented it!  He wants you to do it.  Text if you want to, that's cool, but pray to God - that's essential.<br /><br />
				There won't be a RNA and he is always F2T.<br /><br />
				<strong>AYT:</strong> Are you there<br />
				<strong>WAN2TLK:</strong> Want to talk?<br />
				<strong>LBM:</strong> Life before mobiles<br />
				<strong>FYI:</strong> For your information<br />
				<strong>HUH:</strong> Have you heard?<br />
				<strong>RNA:</strong> Ring no answer<br />
				<strong>F2T:</strong> Free to talk.<br /></p>
