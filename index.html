				<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
				<center><img src="me2.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></center><br />
				<p>Welcome to my Christian Resources website.  I have been participating in interdenominational church life for over three decades, seeking to lead and encourage others in their worship and faith, creatively.  This site hosts written materials that are both original and 'tried and tested' which can be used by a variety of contemporary church groups.</p>
				<p>I began writing for Scripture Union in 2003, producing Bible notes for teenagers and Christian Union materials.  'Ready-to-use' home group resources were also published online.  I'm currently writing for 'Inspiring Women Every Day' (C.W.R.).</p>
				<p>I've had two books published and sold nationally (further details appear on the site).</p>
				<p>To hear a sample of my writing, click on to the <b>audio books</b>, first broadcast by <b>UCB radio</b>.  Transcripts of these stories can be downloaded.</p>
