                <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>

          <p>Welcome to my Christian Resources website.  I have been participating in interdenominational church life for over three decades, seeking to lead and encourage others in their worship and faith, creatively.  This site hosts written materials that are both original and 'tried and tested' which can be used by a variety of contemporary church groups.</p>
          <p>I began writing for Scripture Union in 2003, producing Bible notes for teenagers and Christian Union materials.  'Ready-to-use' home group resources were also published online.  I'm currently writing for 'Inspiring Women Every Day' (C.W.R.).</p>
          <p>I've had two books published and sold nationally (further details appear on the site) and I'm currently seeking contributions for a possible future publication. Are there any budding authors out there who wish to take up this challenge?...</p>
          <p style="border:1px solid #000;">
              "Calling everyone who owns a mobile phone - whether you're a young person or merely 'young at heart'..."<br />
              <b>If you could take 'a selfie' with a Biblical character, who would it be?</b> Think carefully... think creatively... and then, in a maximum of 150 words, email your response saying WHO and WHY.<br />
              Fascinating replies may be included in a future publication.
          </p>
